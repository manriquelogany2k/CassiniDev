This is strengthening the Swiss franc, traditionally considered a refuge in times of economic and political turbulence. Switzerland-surrounded by, but not a member of, the European Union-is a haven of fiscal and political stability, but turbulence in the currency bloc is a major risk for its economy. The country depends heavily on exports for growth and a strong franc is hindering exports at a time when demand is slumping in the euro zone, Switzerland's biggest trade partner. </p><p>\\n  Because of the threat a euro collapse presents for the country, Berne earlier this year set up a task force to evaluate measures to be taken if this occurred. The task force is led by Swiss central bank president Thomas Jordan, Swiss Finance Minister Evelyne Widmer-Schlumpf and Anne Heritier Lachat, the head of financial-services industry regulator FinMa. </p><p>\\n  \\\"We must be prepared for the worst case, under which the currency union falls apart, even as I don't expect this to happen,\\\" Mr. Jordan said in an interview with Swiss weekly Sonntagszeitung. </p><p>\\n  Worries about the stability of the euro zone have heightened in recent weeks, putting further pressure on the Swiss franc. As result, the euro has traded close to the 1.20 Swiss franc floor that the Swiss National Bank introduced in September when the currency traded at record levels against the euro and the dollar. </p><p>\\n  Mr. Jordan said in the interview that the SNB will continue to defend this level with utmost determination, even under very difficult circumstances. </p><p>\\n  The floor has helped exporters, and contributed to the country avoiding recession. The SNB has so far managed to defend the franc without much visible effort, even though the euro briefly fell below 1.20 francs in April for a few seconds. The drop has been attributed to trades among banks that don't deal directly with the SNB and were selling euros for less than 1.20 francs for reasons that remain unclear. </p><p>\\n  Introducing a minimum rate for the euro against the franc didn't require any involvement from the government, but more extreme measures such as capital controls or negative interest rates would. </p><p>\\n  \\\"The task force focuses on measures that require cooperation between the government and the central bank to fight Swiss franc strength,\\\" Mr. Jordan said in Sonntagszeitung. One such measure would be capital controls, meaning tools, which directly influence the inflow of capital into Switzerland. </p><p>\\n  In the 1970s, Switzerland used extreme measures to curb excessive demand for its currency. The country prohibited foreign investments in Swiss securities and real-estate and introduced negative interest rates on foreign deposits. Both tools failed to stem the Swiss franc's rise, which only halted after the central bank introduced a temporary peg to the deutsche mark, Germany's currency at the time. </p><p>\\n  The SNB's floor on the franc has won the backing of the International Monetary Fund, not usually known for its endorsement of interference with market forces. The fund is more skeptical of other measures, though, warning in its latest report on the Swiss economy that capital-flow measures would be complex to design and costly given the country's role as an international financial center. </p><p>\\n  Mr. Jordan himself recently dismissed negative interest rates on foreign deposits as a tool for curbing haven flows. </p><pre></pre><p>\\n  -By Anita Greil, Dow Jones Newswires, +41 43 443 8044; anita.greil@dowjones.com </p><pre></pre><p>\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p><p>\\n  May 27, 2012 11:02 ET (15:02 GMT)</p>\",\"StoryId\":1416482,\"Headline\":\"UPDATE: Swiss Mull Capital Control In Case Of Euro Break-Up\",\"PublishDate\":\"\\/Date(1338130920000)\\/\"}}",
