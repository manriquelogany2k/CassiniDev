The preliminary estimate of first-quarter U.K. gross domestic product produced by the ONS reported a 0.2% quarterly contraction, which meant the U.K. returned to recession after a 0.3% drop in the final quarter of last year. That was much weaker than the 0.2% to 0.5% first-quarter expansion indicated by the all-sector PMI. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The Bank of England--which closely monitors and discusses all economic data in order to reach the best policy decision each month--said last month that in light of more upbeat business surveys, the economy may be in better health than official figures show. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  So, given the recent divergence--which comes after the official data and PMIs were pretty much in line with each other for the past 20 years--which set of figures is more credible? <\\/p><p>\\u000a  Rather than choosing between the two, U.K. economist for Scotiabank GBM Alan Clarke said the difference is down to exactly what the two data sets are measuring. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  \\\"I find it really hard to criticize either the PMIs or the ONS,\\\" Clarke said. \\\"I suspect that lags are responsible for the divergence between the PMIs and GDP during first quarter. Sentiment can turn the corner much quicker than hard activity data. So the PMIs were probably not wrong--just a bit ahead of themselves.\\\" <\\/p><p>\\u000a  Statistically speaking, however, the much larger number of firms questioned in the government analysis should give a fairer and truer measure of activity. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  \\\"The larger sample size would tend to eliminate random and haphazard variation much better than the smaller one,\\\" said Steffen Lauritzen, head of the statistics department at the University of Oxford. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The ONS questions 7,000 firms for its industrial production survey where Markit speaks to 600. For the services data--a sector that accounts for 76% of gross domestic product--the ONS contacts 28,000 firms while Markit quizzes 700. And, for construction data, the ONS speaks with 8,000 businesses per month compared with just 170 by Markit. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The latest official construction data for March are due Friday. They will draw close scrutiny after the first-quarter figures estimated a quarterly slump of 3.0%, not least because other surveys, including Markit's construction PMI, have reported a much healthier sector in recent months. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The inclusion of the final month of the first quarter may have some impact on the preliminary first-quarter GDP estimate when revised figures are released in two weeks. But after the official industrial production data confirmed the 0.4% quarterly decline estimated by the ONS two weeks ago, the possibility that a significant revision will result is small. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The March index on services, which will be released alongside the second GDP reading, provides the biggest possibility of a significant revision. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the recent divergence is unusual because the PMI data have generally tracked official figures pretty closely over the past 20 years around the globe. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  \\\"As to the divergence at the moment--we can't explain it,\\\" Williamson told Dow Jones Newswires. \\\"But we think things were better than they're estimated at the moment. They [the ONS] have perhaps ignored too much of March, which was a very strong month for the economy, certainly for the service sector and construction. So hopefully when the numbers comes through we will see an upward revision to the GDP number.\\\" <\\/p><p>\\u000a  Williamson added that one of the motivations for setting Markit up was order to provide a way of cross-checking the official numbers. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  \\\"The whole reason why we started the business 20 years ago was because there was a lack of faith in official data--it tended to be revised and rather late and the only accurate data seemed to be for the manufacturing sector. Twenty years on, all those arguments seem to apply,\\\" Williamson said. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  The ONS, meanwhile, points to the number of firms surveyed and the type of questions asked when approached about the divergence between official data and the recent PMI surveys. <\\/p><p>\\u000a  \\\"The ONS data are mainly collected from representative large samples collecting figures from over 40,000 businesses on their actual values of turnover or output, depending on the type of industry,\\\" an ONS spokesperson said. \\\"The PMIs tend to survey larger businesses, and record whether a business thinks output has risen, fallen or stayed about the same.\\\" <\\/p><pre><\\/pre><p>\\u000a  -By Ilona Billington and Ainsley Thomson, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842 9452; Ilona.Billington@dowjones.com <\\/p><pre><\\/pre><p>\\u000a  (END) Dow Jones Newswires<\\/p><p>\\u000a  May 12, 2012 18:00 ET (22:00 GMT)<\\/p>\"}}",
